		<h2>theory</h2>
		<p>For a long time, we've built sites that specified column widths in HTML. This leads to a compromised design, with an app or site that looks good on a single large resolution, and reasonable on mobile. It also produces HTML stuffed with non-semantic class names.</p>
		<p>This isn't good enough.</p>
		<p>The Open Digital Application Wireframing Styleset (or OpenDAWS) is an attempt to correct this.</p>
	</div>
	<div id="opendawsis">
		<h2>what OpenDAWS is...</h2>
		<p>OpenDAWS can be thought of as an structured library; that is to say, it's a huge set of resets and helpful classes, as well as the logic for grid layouts, but without any of the constraints of a full framework. There's no fixed grid you have to adhere to. Instead, you simply apply widths to containing element IDs.</p>
		<p>This means that you can create a design limited in width only by the user's viewport size. Want a design that adapts at 320px, 768px, 1024px, 1600px, 1920px, 2560px & 4096px? Easy!</p>
		<p>Moreover, by not specifying widths in HTML, we're free to completely change how our design looks at these sizes. Thus an element that's 4 columns width at 320px can be 8 columns width at 1024px, or 9 columns at 1920px, or 16 columns at 4096px. The limit is your design knowledge, rather than fixed HTML.</p>
	</div>
	<div id="opendawsisnt">
		<h2>...& what it isn't</h2>
		<p>This is <em>not</em> a full framework, in the vein of <a href="http://foundation.zurb.com/">Foundation</a>, <a href="http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/">Bootstrap</a> or <a href="http://www.getskeleton.com/">Skeleton</a>. Those all come with a set grid, which this doesn't. As such, if you're new to design, I'd suggest going with one of those; they'll give you a firmer foundation on which to learn.</p>
		<p>It's also not an attempt to style everything. Whilst OpenDAWS includes a full set of typographic stacks, and some pleasant defaults for buttons and forms, it's designed to be extended. As such, you're going to need to write a lot of CSS on top of it.</p>
		<p>Finally, it's <em>not</em> backwards incompatible. Everything's supported back to IE6, through <a href="http://modernizr.com/">Modernizr</a> and <a href="http://selectivizr.com/">selectivizr</a> powered with Mootools. Feel free to use [attr=], :first/last/only-child, :focus and so on. For added support, you can team it up with NWMatcher or MooTools, for complete IE6+ pseudo class support!</p>
